    "In conclusion, it seems that American Airlines can improve their performance regarding delays as well as cancellations. Some of their competitors have higher rates of delays and longer delays on average. However, there are also competitors with less and shorter delays at the same time as well less cancellations. A deeper understanding of the relevant processes and analysis of the competitors is necessary to find ways to improve those points. </br></br>\n",
    "Additionally, there are first hints where to look for improvements. The rate of delays is increased on Mondays and Fridays. Therefore, an analysis is necessary to find differences of those days compared to others. Furthermore, the rate of delayed flights and average delay length is increased in September and also relatively high in December. Of the destination airports JFK airport has the lowest rate of delays, but the highest average delay length. Further inverstigations on this could also reveal ideas how to improve performance. </br></br>\n",
    "As mentioned before, further investigations are necessary to find mechanisms to improve the delay and cancellation performance of American Airlines. Data of the customers, aircrafts, staff could help in this case. Additionally, processes of competitors could be analyzed as far as possible, especially of those with low delay rates and short delay durations. "
